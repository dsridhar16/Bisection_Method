# Bisection_Method
The code required one loop and I used an if condition to check where in the mid-point would be. If the value of the function at the starting point or the end point was less than 0, we know that it crosses the x-axis, indicating that there is a root there. And through all these iterations, I check the value of function at the midpoint. If the value is very close to 0 (about 10^-11), I say that it is fairly close to the root value and define that value as the root. If not, it keeps changing the midpoint until it finally finds the root. 
When using the Bisection Method, I have one starting point of -1 and one ending point of -0.5. It tells me that the root will be at -0.9541. For the other root, I have a starting point of -0.5 and an ending point of 0. It tells me the value of the root is at -0.15098.
